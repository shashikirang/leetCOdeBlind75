You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

To solve this problem, you can notice that to reach step n, you can either:

Come from step n-1 by taking 1 step, or
Come from step n-2 by taking 2 steps.
This means that the number of ways to reach step n is the sum of the number of ways to reach step n-1 and the number of ways to reach step n-2.

This gives us the recurrence relation:
ways(𝑛)=ways(𝑛−1)+ways(𝑛−2)
ways(n)=ways(n−1)+ways(n−2)

This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where:

ways(1) = 1 (only one way to take one step)
ways(2) = 2 (two ways: [1 step + 1 step] or [2 steps])
