Imagine you have a collection of bags, and each bag is filled with a certain number of balls. These bags are represented by an array, where each element of the array corresponds to the number of balls in a bag, for example, nums[i] is the number of balls in the i-th bag.
You're given a specific number of operations that you can perform, denoted by maxOperations. In a single operation, you can choose any one of your bags and split its contents into two new bags. The new bags must contain a positive number of balls, meaning each bag must have at least one ball.
The "penalty" is defined as the largest number of balls in any single bag. The goal is to minimize this penalty at the end of all your operations.
For example, if you start with a bag of 5 balls, you could split it into bags containing 3 and 2 balls, respectively. If this is your only bag, your initial penalty is 5 (since it's the only bag), but after the operation, it's reduced to 3.
You need to determine the minimum possible penalty you can achieve after performing at most maxOperations operations.


#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // Include algorithm header for max_element

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        // Initialize binary search bounds
        int left = 1;
        int right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Find maximum value in nums
      
        // Perform binary search to find the minimum possible size of the largest bag after operations
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Prevent potential overflow
            long long operationCount = 0; // Store number of operations needed for current bag size
          
            // Calculate the number of operations needed to reduce bags to size at most 'mid'
            for (int num : nums) {
                operationCount += (num - 1) / mid;
            }
          
            // If the number of operations is less than or equal to maxOperations, try smaller bag size
            if (operationCount <= maxOperations) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                // If more operations are needed, increase the bag size
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
      
        // Once left == right, we've found the minimum size of the largest bag
        return left;
    }
};





Letâ€™s dry-run the given logic step-by-step for the input:

---

### Input:
- `nums = [9, 8, 2]`
- `maxOperations = 2`

---

### Dry Run of the Logic

#### **Initialization**
- \( \text{left} = 1 \)
- \( \text{right} = \max(\text{nums}) = 9 \)

---

### **Binary Search Iterations**

#### **Iteration 1:**
1. **Calculate mid**:  
   \( \text{mid} = \text{left} + \frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2} = 1 + \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 5 \)  

2. **Calculate operations needed for \( \text{mid} = 5 \):**
   - For \( 9 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{9 - 1}{5} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.6 \rfloor = 1 \)
   - For \( 8 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{8 - 1}{5} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.4 \rfloor = 1 \)
   - For \( 2 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{2 - 1}{5} \rfloor = \lfloor 0.2 \rfloor = 0 \)

   **Total Operations = \(1 + 1 + 0 = 2\)**  

3. **Check operation count**:  
   \( \text{operationCount (2)} \leq \text{maxOperations (2)} \).  
   - Reduce \( \text{right} \): \( \text{right} = \text{mid} = 5 \)

---

#### **Iteration 2:**
1. **Calculate mid**:  
   \( \text{mid} = \text{left} + \frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2} = 1 + \frac{5 - 1}{2} = 3 \)

2. **Calculate operations needed for \( \text{mid} = 3 \):**
   - For \( 9 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{9 - 1}{3} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.7 \rfloor = 2 \)
   - For \( 8 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{8 - 1}{3} \rfloor = \lfloor 2.3 \rfloor = 2 \)
   - For \( 2 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{2 - 1}{3} \rfloor = \lfloor 0.3 \rfloor = 0 \)

   **Total Operations = \(2 + 2 + 0 = 4\)**  

3. **Check operation count**:  
   \( \text{operationCount (4)} > \text{maxOperations (2)} \).  
   - Increase \( \text{left} \): \( \text{left} = \text{mid} + 1 = 4 \)

---

#### **Iteration 3:**
1. **Calculate mid**:  
   \( \text{mid} = \text{left} + \frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2} = 4 + \frac{5 - 4}{2} = 4 \)

2. **Calculate operations needed for \( \text{mid} = 4 \):**
   - For \( 9 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{9 - 1}{4} \rfloor = \lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2 \)
   - For \( 8 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{8 - 1}{4} \rfloor = \lfloor 1.75 \rfloor = 1 \)
   - For \( 2 \): Operations = \( \lfloor \frac{2 - 1}{4} \rfloor = \lfloor 0.25 \rfloor = 0 \)

   **Total Operations = \(2 + 1 + 0 = 3\)**  

3. **Check operation count**:  
   \( \text{operationCount (3)} > \text{maxOperations (2)} \).  
   - Increase \( \text{left} \): \( \text{left} = \text{mid} + 1 = 5 \)

---

### **Termination**
When \( \text{left} = \text{right} \), the binary search ends.  
- The minimum possible size of the largest bag is \( \text{left} = 5 \).

---

### **Final Result**
The minimum possible size of the largest bag is **5**.
